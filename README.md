[![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/astronomer/ap-airflow/tree/master.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/astronomer/ap-airflow/tree/master) [![docker-pulls](https://img.shields.io/docker/pulls/astronomerinc/ap-airflow.svg)](https://hub.docker.com/r/astronomerinc/ap-airflow)

Astronomer makes it easy to run, monitor, and scale [Apache Airflow](https://github.com/apache/airflow) deployments in our cloud or yours. Source code is made available for the benefit of customers.

If you'd like to see the platform in action, [start a free trial on our SaaS service, Astronomer Cloud](https://astronomer.io/trial) and run through our [getting started guide](https://www.astronomer.io/docs/getting-started/). This is a good first step, even if you're ultimately interested in running Astronomer in your own Kubernetes cluster.
